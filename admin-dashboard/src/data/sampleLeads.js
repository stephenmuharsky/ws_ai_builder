    nurtureEmailDraft: 'Hi Robert,\n\nThank you for booking your consultation with NorthStar Wealth Advisory. We\'re looking forward to meeting with you on Tuesday, February 25th at 2:00 PM.\n\nI wanted to reach out personally because I know that switching advisors is a significant decision — and I want you to feel confident that you\'re in good hands from day one.\n\nTo make our first conversation as productive as possible, here are a few things you might want to have handy:\n\n• Your most recent investment statements (from all accounts)\n• Any existing estate planning documents (will, powers of attorney)\n• A rough sense of your retirement timeline and lifestyle goals\n\nOf course, there\'s no pressure to have everything ready — we\'ll work through it together at whatever pace feels right.\n\nIf you have any questions before our meeting, don\'t hesitate to reach out. I\'m here to help.\n\nWarm regards,\nJames Wilson\nSenior Wealth Advisor, NorthStar Wealth Advisory',
